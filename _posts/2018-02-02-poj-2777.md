Description

Chosen Problem Solving and Program design as an optional course, you are required to solve all kinds of problems. Here, we get a new problem. 

There is a very long board with length L centimeter, L is a positive integer, so we can evenly divide the board into L segments, and they are labeled by 1, 2, ... L from left to right, each is 1 centimeter long. Now we have to color the board - one segment with only one color. We can do following two operations on the board: 

1. "C A B C" Color the board from segment A to segment B with color C. 
2. "P A B" Output the number of different colors painted between segment A and segment B (including). 

In our daily life, we have very few words to describe a color (red, green, blue, yellow…), so you may assume that the total number of different colors T is very small. To make it simple, we express the names of colors as color 1, color 2, ... color T. At the beginning, the board was painted in color 1. Now the rest of problem is left to your. 
Input

First line of input contains L (1 <= L <= 100000), T (1 <= T <= 30) and O (1 <= O <= 100000). Here O denotes the number of operations. Following O lines, each contains "C A B C" or "P A B" (here A, B, C are integers, and A may be larger than B) as an operation defined previously.
Output

Ouput results of the output operation in order, each line contains a number.
Sample Input

2 2 4
C 1 1 2
P 1 2
C 2 2 2
P 1 2
Sample Output

会给我们木棍的长度，颜料的种类以及操作数，木棍的初始颜色全是1号颜色，每次操作选定棍子上的一个范围使其全部涂上一种颜色，最后问操作结束后，棍子上有多少种不同的颜色




唔很明显的线段树。。。然后颜色最多30种，考虑每种颜色用二进制表示，二进制的1的个数表示颜色的种类的个数，这样对于单个的颜色x，用来表示则是 1 << (x - 1)，然后延迟标记lazy表示该节点的儿子都会被染成lazy色（类似于区间更新（唔我好像还没写区间更新））。同时感谢hls让我对lazy有了更深的理解。

最后每个节点的颜色种类数等于子节点进行位或运算。最后相当于对全区间进行一次查询。




本质上其实还是一个裸题，但开始还是被窝写坏惹。。。。
